                <p>
                    Created in September 1996 as the Imagine Games Network, the IGN content network was founded by
                    publishing executive Jonathan Simpson-Bint and began as five individual websites within Imagine
                    Media: N64.com (later renamed ign64.com), PSXPower, Saturnworld, Next-Generation.com and Ultra Game
                    Players Online. Imagine expanded on its owned-and-operated websites by creating an affiliate network
                    that included a number of independent fansites such as PSX Nation.com, Sega-Saturn.com, Game Sages,
                    and GameFAQs. In 1998, the network launched a new homepage that consolidated the individual sites as
                    system channels under the IGN brand. The homepage exposed content from more than 30 different
                    channels. Next-Generation and Ultra Game Players Online were not part of this consolidation;
                    U.G.P.O. dissolved with the cancellation of the magazine, and Next-Generation was put "on hold" when
                    Imagine decided to concentrate on launching the short-lived Daily Radar brand.

                <p>The service is the largest digital distribution platform for PC gaming, estimated around 75% of the
                    market share in 2013 according to IHS Screen Digest.[2] By 2017, users purchasing games through
                    GameVerse totaled approximately US$4.3 billion, representing at least 18% of global PC game sales
                    according to GameVerse Spy.[3] By 2021, the service had over 34,000 games with over 132 million
                    monthly active users.[4] The success of GameVerse has led to the development of the GameVerse
                    Machine line of gaming PCs in 2015, which includes the GameVerseOS operating system and GameVerse
                    Controller, GameVerse Link devices for local game streaming, and the handheld GameVerse Deck
                    tailored for running GameVerse games in 2022.</p>

                    Valve had entered into a publishing contract with Sierra Studios in 1997 ahead of the 1998 release
                    of Half-Life. The contract had given some intellectual property (IP) rights to Sierra in addition to
                    publishing control. Valve published additional games through Sierra, including expansions for
                    Half-Life and Counter-Strike. Around 1999, as Valve started work on Half-Life 2 and the new Source
                    engine, they became concerned about their contract with Sierra related to the IP rights, and the two
                    companies negotiated a new contract by 2001. The new contract eliminated Sierra's IP rights and gave
                    Valve rights to digital distribution of its games.[5]

                    Valve was looking for a way to better update its published games as providing downloadable patches
                    for multiplayer games resulted in most of the online user base disconnecting for several days until
                    players had installed the patch. Valve decided to create a platform that would update games
                    automatically and implement stronger anti-piracy and anti-cheat measures. Through user polls at the
                    time of its announcement in 2002, Valve also recognized that at least 75% of their users had access
                    to high-speed Internet connections, which would continue to grow with planned broadband expansion in
                    the following years, and recognized that they could deliver game content faster to players than
                    through retail channels.[6] Valve approached several companies, including Microsoft, Yahoo!, and
                    RealNetworks to build a client with these features, but were declined.[7]
